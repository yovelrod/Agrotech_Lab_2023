# Agrotech_Lab_2023 project:
The purpose of my project was to build a meteorological station to measure climate data such as wind speed, temperature, and humidity in my residential area. To achieve this goal, I utilized various sensors, including a wind sensor for measuring wind speed and direction, a temperature sensor, a humidity sensor, and a barometric pressure sensor. Additionally, to ensure the station's placement in a representative location with minimal environmental disturbances, I had to position it far away from a power source. Therefore, I incorporated a battery that could be charged using a solar panel.
